things to add to IVT code
-- good error reporting on CAN and in general
-- flickering of LEDs according to MCU error status
-- ADC error is inconsistent on different MCU pins - on development board pin A0 it is +(20 to 40), on pin A1 it is only +(10 to 20).
   Need to troubleshoot this more  
-- Implement periodic re-calibration based on the internal temperature sensor?
